# Corona-Virus-Deep-Learning-Competition

For this competition I used research by Grisoni et al. hosted at https://github.com/ETHmodlab/BIMODAL to generate ligands which I then docked using Autodock Vina by O. Trott and A. J. Olson: http://vina.scripps.edu/.

I created a Python wrapper to take the SMILE string generated by the Bimodal RNN model, convert it to a usable format using Python scripts included with Autodock Vina, and then to dock it with Autodock Vina.
